## Running in your machine

### Requirements

- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- Yarn\*
- Expo

<small>Everything can be done with NPM, but you better change the package.json scripts to match NPM instead of Yarn</small>

### Commands

To install the dependencies, run:

```
yarn
```

Once everything is installed and an auto-generated node_modules pop's up, run the following:

```
yarn start
```
